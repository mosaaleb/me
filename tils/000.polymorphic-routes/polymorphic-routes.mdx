Rails polymorphic routes are a smart way to generate paths for Active Record
model instances. Suppose that you are working on an application that allows
multiple models to be liked.

<br />

For example if you have `Post` and `Comment` models, that could be liked by a
user, to generate the routes for liking a post or a comment, we could write:

```ruby
# routes
resources :post do
  member do
    post 'like', to: 'likes#create'
    delete 'dislike', to: 'likes#destroy'
  end
end

resources :comment do
  member do
    post 'like', to: 'likes#create'
    delete 'dislike', to: 'likes#destroy'
  end
end
```

These routes could be refactored by using
[concerns](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#routing-concerns)
, but for the sake of this post, let's
keep it that way.

<br />

Also, I prefer using member routes here, because it generates more meaningful
paths in this particular case. Consider having `like_post_path` instead of
`post_likes_path` if you used nested resources. The path name also reflects
that action being taken by the user.

Another reason for using member routes, because i personally find it more easy
to remember path names.

Now if you want to generate path for liking and disliking a post or a comment,
you will have to check if the likable is a `post` or a `comment` to generate
the right path for it.

```ruby
# paths for liking or disliking a post
link_to 'like', like_post_path(@post), method: :post
link_to 'dislike', dislike_post_path(@post), method: :delete

# paths for liking or disliking a comment
link_to 'like', like_comment_path(@post), method: :post
link_to 'dislike', dislike_comment_path(@post), method: :delete
```

But with using `polymorphic_path`, this can be refactored into:

```ruby
link_to 'like', polymorphic_path([:like, @likable]), method: :post
link_to 'dislike', polymorphic_path([:dislike, @likable]), method: :delete
```

In this case, `polymorphic_path` generates the right url based on the
`@likable` type.
