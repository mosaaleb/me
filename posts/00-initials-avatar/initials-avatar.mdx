[Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) is an amazing service to quickly
personalize your business users, but despite its power, it comes also with some
disadvantages. The more Gravatars that you have on your page, the slower the
page will load because your application will make a request for every gravatar
to gravatar servers.

<br />

In this guide, we will generate Gmail-like avatars with the user's name
initials, using the [mini-magick](https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick) gem
then attaching users avatars to [active
storage](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html).


## Generating the avatar

Before getting serious, Let's first see a basic example of generating a new image.
For this, we need to install MiniMagick gem.

```bash
gem install mini_magick
```

MiniMagick is a lightweight gem for image processing based on
[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php). So before using it, we
need to install ImageMagick first. Depending on your system, you will find
instructions on how to install it from their
[homepage](https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php).

<br />

Let's, for now, create an image with a gray background.

Create a `avatar.rb` file

```ruby
# avatar.rb
require 'mini_magick'

def generate_image
  MiniMagick::Tool::Convert.new do |image|
    image.size '200x200'
    image.xc 'gray'
    image << 'avatar.jpg'
  end
end

generate_image
```

run the script, you should see a new image with the name `avatar.jpg` having a
gray background appears on the same directory.

Let's add more properties to the generated image:


```ruby
# avatar.rb
require 'mini_magick'

def generate_image
  MiniMagick::Tool::Convert.new do |image|
    image.size '200x200'
    image.gravity 'center'
    image.xc '#561B8D'
    image.pointsize 100
    image.fill '#C8F7C5'
    image.draw "text 0,0 ME"
    image << 'avatar.jpg'
  end
end

generate_image
```

Run the script again, you should see this image with centered "ME" letters.

<br />

![avatar-sample](./images/avatar-sample.jpg)

<br/>

Now we have finished the image generation logic, the real question remains
where to put this logic?

<br/>

My first thought was to use active record callbacks, we can run the
`generate_avatar` method with user name initials after creating a new user, but
there is one problem with using callbacks, `generate_avatar` callback will
create a dependency because creating the user and generating the default image
are tightly coupled together.

<br />

Consider a scenario where you decided to add Omniauth authentication with
Facebook and attach the user avatar to facebook image, this code will still run
while we don't actually need it.

<br />

So instead we can move this logic into the registration controller which
separates the concerns to only creating a user with full registration, but
since controllers are only supposed to have request/response logic, we need a
new design pattern.


## Enter Service Objects

Putting all image generation logic in the registration controller breaks the
more important principle in OOP, single responsibility. So what is the
solution?

<br />

Service objects are just Plain Old Ruby Object (PORO), which should encapsulate
and execute single action.

<br />

Our code should look like:


```ruby
# registration_controller.rb

def create
  # ... user creation logic
  AvatarGenerator.call(user)
end
```

or if you are using [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) gem for
authentication, we need first to
[override](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise#configuring-controllers) the
default `create` action in devise's `registration_controller`.

After generating devise registration controller let's customize the `create`
action to generate the default avatar after creating the new user.

<br />

```ruby
# registration_controller.rb
class Users::RegistrationsController < Devise::RegistrationsController

  def create
    super { AvatarGenerator.call(resource) }
  end

  # ...
end
```

<br />

What this will do is first will call the parent
[`create`](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/blob/master/app/controllers/devise/registrations_controller.rb#L16)
action, and yield any block if any was given, in our case it will execute the
avatar generation logic.


The new avatar generation class is now responsible for one thing, the
registration controller is more readable and doesn't have logic that doesn't
belong to it.


## Adding MiniMagick/Image Processing gem

Now that we have finished with our design decision, let's add our
`AvatarGenerator` class.

Before adding the code, we need to first install MiniMagick in our application.

<br />

To add `mini_magick` gem, you can install
[image_processing](https://github.com/janko/image_processing) gem which is a
wrapper for ImageMagick and libvips. Image Processing gem also provides
[variants](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveStorage/Variant.html) for
your images so that you can create thumbnails, fixed-size avatars, or any other
image manipulations.

Open `Gemfile` and add this line:

```ruby
gem 'image_processing'
```

Or uncomment it if is already there, then run `bundle install` to install the
gem.

<br />

We are going to attach the generated image with Active Storage attachments, so
before moving on make sure that active storage is
[installed](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#setup)


After you have added active storage, add this line to user model:

```ruby
# user.rb

has_one_attached :avatar
```

We are ready now to add our `AvatarGenerator` class, let's move on.

## Adding AvatarGenerator service object class

First, create a new folder inside the `app` directory called `services` which
will hold all service objects that our application will have. Now, let's create
`avatar_generator.rb` file.

This class will:
- Generate initials avatar image for new registered user.
- Attach the newly generated image to the user's avatar with active storage.


```ruby
require 'image_processing/mini_magick'

class AvatarGenerator
  attr_reader :user

  AVATAR_COLORS = { '#561B8D' => '#C8F7C5',
                    '#DFF0D8' => '#468847',
                    '#F0E68C' => '#550055',
                    '#C8C8C8' => '#551700',
                    '#CD594A' => '#FFFFFF' }.freeze

  def self.call(user)
    new(user).call
  end

  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def call
    generate_image
    user.avatar.attach(io: File.open('default.jpg'),
                       filename: "#{user.username}-default.jpg",
                       content_type: 'image/jpg')

    clean
  end

  private

  def generate_image
    rand = rand 0..4
    MiniMagick::Tool::Convert.new do |image|
      image.size '200x200'
      image.gravity 'center'
      image.xc AVATAR_COLORS.keys[rand]
      image.pointsize 100
      image.fill AVATAR_COLORS.values[rand]
      image.draw "text 0,0 #{initial_letters}"
      image << 'default.jpg'
    end
  end

  def initial_letters
    user.first_name.chr.capitalize + user.last_name.chr.capitalize
  end

  def clean
    File.delete('default.jpg')
  end
end
```

I have added some random color choosing functionality to generate different
colors every time you generate an avatar.

<br />

**In conclusion** 
We have implemented a way to programtically generate Gmail-like avatars and
used Service Objects design pattern to DRY fat controllers.

<br />

This concludes our detailed look into generating initials avatars in Rails.
Hopefully, everything is working for you!
