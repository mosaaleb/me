RDoc and ri tools can be extremely useful if you have a slow internet
connection, and need to consult the docs for Ruby Core or any other ruby gems.

<br />

If you are using gem command to install ruby gems, it generates Ruby Docs for
the installed gems.

<br />

RDoc and ri are useful tools to create/generate/view documentation for
ruby-core and installed ruby gems. I like them because they allow you to read
the docs without leaving your editor and interrupting your workflow.

<br />

To use it, just pass the class or method that you searching for:

```bash
ri ActiveRecord::Base
ri ActiveRecord::Base.save
```

<br />

Quoted from ri docs:
> A '.' matches either class or instance methods, while #method matches only
instance and ::method matches only class methods.

<br />

If you don't enjoy reading the docs from the terminal, RubyGems got your back!

[RubyGems](https://guides.rubygems.org/) when installed ships with `gem
server` command. This will serve all installed gems in your system. You can
then search for any gem and browse their docs in the browser.

```bash
~ gem server
Server started at http://0.0.0.0:8808
```

Enjoy your local docs ;)
