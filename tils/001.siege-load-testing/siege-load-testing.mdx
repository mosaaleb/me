[Siege](https://linux.die.net/man/1/siege) is a great open-source tool to
analyze loads in HTTP requests and benchmark server performance.

<br />

## What is load testing?
Load testing is a form of non-functional testing, which will give you helpful
insights about at what point your website will crash.

There's a lot of tools that you can use to perform load and stress testing. We
are going to focus on Siege.

Siege allows you to hit a web server with a configurable number of concurrent
simulated users.

To demonstrate, I have a simple Rails application, with just one route and one
controller.

<br />

```ruby
# routes.rb
get '/page', to: 'pages#index'

# pages_controller.rb
def index
  render json: { hello: :world }
end
```

<br />

First, install Siege in your system, start the rails server, then run this
command:

<br />

```sh
siege -b --content-type 'application/json' -c 50 -r 40 'http://localhost:3000/pages'
```

<br />

This command will simulate 50 users hitting `http://localhost:3000/pages`
URL, for 40 times repetition for every user.

Siege will take a few seconds to run the simulation and will generate this
report:

<br />

```
** SIEGE 4.0.4
** Preparing 50 concurrent users for battle.
The server is now under siege...
Transactions:                   2000 hits
Availability:                 100.00 %
Elapsed time:                 252.99 secs
Data transferred:               0.03 MB
Response time:                  6.25 secs
Transaction rate:               7.91 trans/sec
Throughput:                     0.00 MB/sec
Concurrency:                   49.41
Successful transactions:        2000
Failed transactions:               0
Longest transaction:            7.33
Shortest transaction:           0.38
```

<br />

You will notice that Siege runs 2000 hits on your server, which is the number
of 50 users hitting the sever each for 40 times.

Check Siege [documentation](https://linux.die.net/man/1/siege) for more
more description on the generated stattistics.

<br />

If you found yourself running this command frequently, you can create a
the script inside the `bin` folder to automate this task.

```bash
#! /bin/bash

REPS=20
CONCURRENCY=30
CONTENT_TYPE='application/json'
URL='http://localhost:3000/pages'

siege -b --content-type $CONTENT_TYPE -c $CONCURRENCY -r $REPS $URL
```

<br />

Now, you can run this script by just typing `bin/siege.sh` in your terminal.
